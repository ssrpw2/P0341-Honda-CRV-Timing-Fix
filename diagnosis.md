# Diagnosis
- Check for Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC): P0341
- Physical Noise Check: A "slapping" or "rattling" noise
- Visual Inspection: Remove timing chain tensioner plate, if the tensioner is extended near its max range
- Compare Timing Marks: Rotate crankshaft to Top Dead Center (TDC) and check intake and exhaust cam gear marks
- Complete Compression Test: Low compression across all cylindars indicate valve timing is off
- Cold Start Rattle Test: Listen for metallic rattle lasting 1-3 seconds on cold start
- Oil Condition/Level Check: The Variable Timing Control function relies on clean and good oil pressure
- VTC Solenoid Test: Check Ohms across both posts (05-10 Ohms), supply 12 Volts for full piston engagement
- Manual Inspection: Can you freely rotate the intake camshaft both directions without it locking
