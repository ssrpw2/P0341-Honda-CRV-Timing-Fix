# Diagnosis

When the Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) PO341 is present, the fastest way to check the timing is to take the engine valve cover off and inspect the timing marks that are on the intake and exhaust camshafts. It is better to assume that PO341 is accurately indicating that the camshaft and crankshaft positions are not lined up, then to assume the sensor is faulty and giving a bad reading. The vehicle can be checked to confirm mechanical alignment issues. 

* Remove the bolts and ignition coil packs so that the valve cover can be taken off. Use a flathead screwdriver to get leverage to pry it off, taking care to not damage the gasket between the cover and the engine block.
* Remove the passenger side (left front) tire so that the crankshaft can be accessed to rotate
* Rotate the engine to top dead center (TDC). A socket and wrench can be used to do this, or a pulley attachment
* Check the timing marks on the VTC actuator (attached to the intake camshaft) and on the camshaft sprocket (exhaust camshaft). If your vehicle is not timed correctly, you will see that the lines are off by at least a tooth.

If you are still unsure, you can do a compression test. Low compression readings across all cylinders indicate that the timing is off. 

For a more invoved inspection, the engine side cover plate can be removed to check the chain tensioner and guides. 

On the vehicle I worked on, I opted to replace the following components: timing chain, timing tensionor and guides, VTC actuator, and VTC solenoid. If your vehilce timing is off, at the minimum replace the timing chain, tensionor and guides. It is likely that the VTC actuator needs replaced as well. This can be checked by rotating the VTC actuator. If it does not lock, it needs to be replaced. 

The VTC solenoid can also be tested. Pull this part out for inspection. If the piston is visible, it needs to be replaced. Check Ohms across both posts (05-10 Ohms), and supply 12 Volts. Check that the piston fully engages. On the vehicle I worked on, the piston was seated properly on inspection. However, I pulled out the filter for the solenoid and found dark, sludgy oil and particles in the filter. I decided to replace it based on this.
