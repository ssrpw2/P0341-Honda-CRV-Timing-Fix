# Fixing Honda CR-V P0341 Code (("Camshaft Position Sensor A - Bank 1 Circuit Range/Performance")
Includes materials and instructions for diagnosis and full mechanical fix for Honda CR-V code P0341. Includes descriptions and diagrams for timing correction, resetting the power control module (PCM) idle learn process, and crank pattern relearn.
## Overview
This project documents how I diagnosed and successfully fixed a P0341 trouble code on a Honda CR-V.

Despite replacing the chain, guides, tensioner, and VTC actuator, and oil solenoid, the code persisted. Careful inspection revealed a slight timing mark misalignment at the crankshaft â€” a mistake that is easy to make. 
This guide includes:
- Symptoms I noticed
- Step-by-step diagnosis
- How I corrected the mechanical timing
- Common pitfalls
- Resources (excerpts from the service manual, photos, videos, links to helpful forums)

I hope this helps other DIY mechanics and helps prevent engine failure for those who have this code come up.
