# Fixing Honda CR-V P0341 Code 
_Camshaft Position (CMP) Sensor and Crankshaft Position (CKP) Sensor Incorrect Phase Detected_
----------------
Includes materials and instructions for diagnosis and full mechanical fix for 2010 Honda CR-V code P0341. Includes descriptions and diagrams for timing correction, resetting the power control module (PCM) idle learn process, and crank pattern relearn.
> ⚠️ **Work in Progress**  
> This guide is still being built. I’m actively working on adding:
> - Photos of the engine components
> - Diagrams of camshaft/crankshaft timing marks
> - Scanner data screenshots
> - Step-by-step instructions
## Overview
This project documents how I diagnosed and successfully fixed a P0341 trouble code on a 2010 Honda CR-V.

## Background
Despite replacing the timing chain, guides, tensioner, Variable Timing Control (VTC) actuator, and oil solenoid, the code persisted. Careful inspection revealed a slight timing mark misalignment at the crankshaft — a mistake that is easy to make. 
This guide includes:
- Symptoms I noticed
- Step-by-step diagnosis
- How I corrected the mechanical timing
- Common pitfalls
- Steps to use software to reset the PCM and complete the necessary relearn procedures 
- Resources (excerpts from the service manual, photos, videos, links to helpful forums)

Importance of early detection: A mistimed engine can cause catastrophic engine damage if untreated. Do not ignore this code - get it fixed immediately.
