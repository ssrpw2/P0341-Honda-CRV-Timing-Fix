# Fixing Honda CR-V P0341 Code (_Camshaft Position (CMP) Sensor and Crankshaft Position (CKP) Sensor Incorrect Phase Detected_)
Includes materials and instructions for diagnosis and full mechanical fix for Honda CR-V code P0341. Includes descriptions and diagrams for timing correction, resetting the power control module (PCM) idle learn process, and crank pattern relearn.

## Overview
This project documents how I diagnosed and successfully fixed a P0341 trouble code on a 2010 Honda CR-V.

## Background
Despite replacing the chain, guides, tensioner, and VTC actuator, and oil solenoid, the code persisted. Careful inspection revealed a slight timing mark misalignment at the crankshaft — a mistake that is easy to make. 
This guide includes:
- Symptoms I noticed
- Step-by-step diagnosis
- How I corrected the mechanical timing
- Common pitfalls
- Steps to use software to reset the PCM and complete the necessary relearn procedures 
- Resources (excerpts from the service manual, photos, videos, links to helpful forums)

Importance of early detection: A mistimed engine can cause catastrophic engine damage if untreated. Do not ignore this code - get it fixed immediately.
