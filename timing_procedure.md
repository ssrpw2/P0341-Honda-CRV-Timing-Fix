# Timing Procedure 


# Aliging the Camshafts


Factory timing mark alignment between intake and exhaust cam gears on a Honda K-series engine
> The correct alignment is **peak-to-valley** for the gear teeth. 
> Some DIYers mistakenly assume both marks should land on matching gear tooth peaks â€” but this is not the case.  
> Trust the service manual marks, not assumptions based on symmetry.

I have included the diagram from the service manual for intake/exhaust cam gear alignment when at top dead center (TDC) as well as photos of the engine I worked on.
